Using the following data set:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/cemalefetezcan/imdb-review-sentiment-classification
divide the data into train/validation data sets, build 2 models to perform movie review sentiment 
analysis
Model 1:
1. Perform required text pre-processing â€“ lowering text, removing URLs, punctuation , stop 
words and correct spelling .
2. Perform tokenization and lemmatization on cleaned data .
3. Visualize the most frequent words and bigrams
4. Visualize the practical words that represent positive and negative sentiment in the dataset.
5. Create an embedding layer and build a 15 layer LSTM and a 20 layer BidRNN for 
predicting the sentiment.
6. Build your own test dataset with 10 movie reviews and tabulate accuracy
