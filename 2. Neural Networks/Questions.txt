Exer 1:
Using the Body Fat dataset, design a Neural Network to predict body fat. Accurate measurement of 
body fat is inconvenient/costly and it is desirable to have easy methods of predicting Body Fat.
The attributes are :
1. Density determined from underwater weighing
2. Percent body fat from Siri's (1956) equation
3. Age (years)
4. Weight (lbs)
5. Height (inches)
6. Neck circumference (cm)
7. Chest circumference (cm)
8. Abdomen 2 circumference (cm)
9. Hip circumference (cm)
10. Thigh circumference (cm)
11. Knee circumference (cm)
12. Ankle circumference (cm)
13. Biceps (extended) circumference (cm)
14. Forearm circumference (cm)
15. Wrist circumference (cm)
1. Perform experiments using (70,15,15) split and tabulate the performance in terms of RMSE 
for the following Hyper parameters : 
a. Number of Hidden Layers and Number of Units per Layer
Number of Hidden Layers | Number of Units
		1 		|  128, 0 ,0
		2 		|  128, 64, 0
		3 		|  128, 64, 32
b. Epochs (10,20,30,40)
c. Activation function (Sigmoid /RELU)
d. Without Regularization, with Regularization (L1/L2)
e. Learning rate (1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.01,0.03,0.001,0.0001,0.00001)
2. Visualize the training and validation loss against the epochs and comment on optimal 
hyperparameters.
