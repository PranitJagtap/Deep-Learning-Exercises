EXERCISE 1: 
https://keras.io/examples/structured_data/wide_deep_cross_networks/
Use the Covertype dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The task is to 
predict forest cover type from cartographic variables.
Create two representations of the input features: sparse and dense: 
1. In the sparse representation, the categorical features are encoded with one-hot 
encoding using the CategoryEncoding layer. This representation can be useful for the 
model to memorize particular feature values to make certain predictions. 
2. In the dense representation, the categorical features are encoded with low-dimensional 
embeddings using the Embedding layer. This representation helps the model 
to generalize well to unseen feature combinations.
Split the data into training (85%) and validation (15%) sets.
Model 1 :
Create a multi-layer feed-forward network, where the categorical features are one-hot 
encoded.
learning_rate = 0.001
dropout_rate = 0.1
batch_size = 265
num_epochs = 50
hidden_units = [32, 32]
Model 2:
Create a Wide & Deep model where the wide part of the model a linear model, while the 
deep part of the model is a multi-layer feed-forward network. Use the sparse 
representation of the input features in the wide part of the model and the dense 
representation of the input features for the deep part of the model.
Model 3:
Create a Deep & Cross model. The deep part of this model is the same as the deep part 
created in the previous experiment. The key idea of the cross part is to apply explicit 
feature crossing in an efficient way, where the degree of cross features grows with layer 
depth.
Compare the loss and accuracy of the three models.
